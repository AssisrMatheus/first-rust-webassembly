# first-rust-webassembly
My first rust/webassembly experiment

Done following https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html

- Make sure [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) is installed
- Make sure `wasm-pack` is installed from cargo
  - If on windows also make sure to install https://strawberryperl.com/
- Open terminal in "www" folder
- `npm start` runs it (the prestart command will build the rust code)
